# School-Management-System

![developer](gulzar).

This is the repository for my **School Project**. This is a **School management system** build with C++ language.
Admin can register new students to the school, upload student's marks, upload notices, add a new admin etc.
Students can upload articles, display their results and personal information by logging in to their respective account.
When admin is logged in he cannot access pages like "upload student article" and "display marks".
When student is logged in he cannot access pages like "new admission" "enter records" "delete records" "upload notices".
